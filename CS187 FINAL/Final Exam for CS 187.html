    <h1>My name is Dennis Fuentes...</h1> 
    
    <h2 class="h2"> And here is a little about me </h2>
    <p> I am a nineteen-year-old from Bellingham Massachusetts. Some of my hobbies include playing soccer and fixing all sorts of electronics. I have played soccer since the age of three and I have Played on a plethora of teams. My highest level of play was for the <a href="https://lfcinternationalacademyma.com/" target="_blank">Liverpool International Academy</a>. My love for technology started at a young age when I broke my first iPod Touch. Rather than buying a new one, I opted to try and repair it myself. After three unsuccessful attempts, I finally repaired my iPod and gained an immense amount of knowledge. This sprung my curiosity, as well as passion, for both hardware and later software development which resulted in my choice of pursuing a computer science degree.  </p>
    
    <h2 class="h2">My High School Accomplishments </h2>
    
    <img src="Images/Graduation%20Photo.jpg" id="gradphoto">
   
     <p> I graduated from <a href="https://bhs.bellinghamk12.org/" target="_blank">Bellingham High School</a> in 2020. Throughout high school my goal was always to challenge myself both physically and academically. I dedicated myself to the Bellingham high school soccer team all five years as a student at Bellingham High. I eventually would become the varsity soccer captain in my junior and senior year. Having played all five years, as well as taking on a captain role, I learned a lot about teamwork, leadership, and becoming a successful role model to other student athletes around me. This along with my academic perseverance would allow me to become a member of both national junior honors society, and national honors society while at Bellingham High, and finishing my time there as the national honors society treasurer. I graduated in the top 10% of my class with honors. I genuinely believe knowledge is power and for this reason I always have strived to be the smartest I could be and push myself academically. </p>
    <h2 class="h2">My College Plans</h2>
    
    <img src="Images/umasslogo.png" id="logo">
    
    <p>Following my career at Bellingham High school, I applied and was accepted at schools such as <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/" target="_blank">Worcester Polytechnical Institute of Technology</a>, <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/" target="_blank">Suffolk University</a>, and <a href="https://wit.edu/" target="_blank">Wentworth Institute of technology</a> but ended up choosing <a href="https://www.umb.edu/" target="_blank">the University of Massachusetts Boston</a> due to a strong financial package, as well as a desire for its beautiful campus and being a short train ride away from the city of Boston. Having known computer science was the field I wanted to pursue since a child, I entered University of Boston as a declared CS major began my first semester virtually this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. So far, I have had no issues with course material, and I was fortunate enough to be able to move into the dorms this semester. I am enjoying learning about what I want to pursue in the future for a change and developing useful skills in a subject area I enjoy working in. Potentially I would enjoy playing soccer for Umass Boston if the pandemic conditions allow. </p>

    <h2 class="h2">My Future Plans</h2>
        
    <p>I plan on staying at University of Boston for all four years of my college experience and graduating with a bachelor’s degree in computer science. After school I would consider returning or pursuing a minor in cyber security. I would love to work for a company that works on developing artificial intelligence in the future, as I am intrigued by all the possibilities that AI brings to the world, or potentially working for a bank or big corporation in the future. I would love to have a job in cyber security and being able to protect people’s information from online hackers. In terms of my personal life, I plan on staying in Massachusetts as I love this area and the four seasons that come along with it.</p>
